Recently I was trying to move an application from one server to another since the free trial for that cloud provider was getting expired ðŸ˜…. I took this opportunity to containerise this application and all it's upstream dependencies and learn something new along the way. I soon realised that containers, especially when it comes to networking, don't quite work the same way as that of a process. There are nuances to how you want to go about setting up your application deployments and there are multiple options to choose from which makes it all the more worse for a newbie. Let's go through it one at a time.

We are not considering the docker swarm specific options here. That was not my use case and since the arrival of Kubernetes you have a better alternative.

Docker provides several networking drivers for you to start your container with. But first let's find out where to look at all the networks that the docker has created for you. 

```bash
$ docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE
4071b98202b2        bridge              bridge              local
badd725b14a0        host                host                local
97a49ff283fd        none                null                local
```

You can see that there are three types of networks docker daemon has already created for you. Each of these have their own names and network-id. We will go into the various drivers and how to use them in them next.

Docker has six networking options you can start your container with 

## 1. Bridge networks

Bridge is a link layer device that forwards traffic between two network segments. It provides an interface through which multiple disparate network segments can interact with each other and behave as a single cohesive unit. Docker uses the same idea to create a software bridge network that provides isolation between the docker host (the machine where the docker daemon is running) and the network that all the containers are running on. A bridge is created as soon as the docker daemon starts and all the containers launched on this host connects to this bridge by default. You can see this bridge network by executing this - 

You can get see details on this network using it's name or id - 

```bash
$ docker network inspect bridge
[
    {
        "Name": "bridge",
        "Id": "15f169f892264417a374f774cd48a332831e64d89f9e1182e958b47183d675c2",
        "Scope": "local",
        "Driver": "bridge",
        "EnableIPv6": false,
        "IPAM": {
            "Driver": "default",
            "Options": null,
            "Config": [
                {
                    "Subnet": "172.17.0.0/16",
                    "Gateway": "172.17.0.1"
                }
            ]
        },
        "Internal": false,
        "Attachable": false,
        "Ingress": false,
        "ConfigFrom": {
            "Network": ""
        },
        "ConfigOnly": false,
        "Containers": {},
    }
]
```

The thing to note here is IP Address Management (IPAM) config. All the containers attaching to this network will get IP addresses from this subnet.

Docker also provides you an option to create your own bridge network if required. These are called User Defined Bridge networks. Let's look at how to create one quickly - 

```bash
$ docker network create custom-network
34c9707787c96e777b3a2e0a2fac6284dd59da9753e3609c4007686b2e91fbbd
$ docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE
4071b98202b2        bridge              bridge              local
34c9707787c9        custom-network      bridge              local
badd725b14a0        host                host                local
97a49ff283fd        none                null                local
```

You can see that a new bridge network named custom network has been defined for you. By default it uses the `bridge` driver so we don't need to specify that here. It has several advantages over the default network. User defined networks allow you to address another container on the same network using it's name along with the IP assigned to it. You also get better isolation for your containers since all other containers listen on the default bridge network. You can also configure your custom network to cater to your requirement which might have unintended consequences on the default network.

## 2. Host networks

Docker allows you to leverage the network of the host machine i.e. the machine where docker daemon is running to launch containers directly. This is similar to launching an application on a host bound to a particular port. The container is assigned no IP address of it's own. You can address the application running inside the container directly using `localhost`. It is very useful when you want to just run an application with behaviour similar to a local installation. One huge limitation to this approach is that you can only use it from Linux.

To use this option, just specify it while launching your container - 

```bash
$ docker run --network host -d nginx:latest
27b01648936d03ccb214dd59f0175a6fada94fb80da32fa7b485ee91c37f2ffc
$ curl localhost:80
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
-----------------------------------------
```

## 3. None

As the name suggests, this is the docker network that does not exist. It is used to provide absolute network isolation to containers by disabling its networking. No incoming or outgoing connections are allowed to and from such containers respectively. To use this option simply supply this with `network` option.

```bash
$ docker run --network host -d nginx:latest
27b01648936d03ccb214dd59f0175a6fada94fb80da32fa7b485ee91c37f2ffc
```

You can `inspect` the container and verify that no IP address has been assigned to it.

## 4. Macvlan

This option enables you to launch containers with MAC addresses assigned to them. Your container behaves as an independent device once launched on this network and can be connect to by those legacy applications that require connection to a physical device. The option might be useful in some cases but docker recommends avoiding this method if feasible.

## 5. Overlay

This is a multi node network that enables you distribute your network over a set of hosts. It allows containers launched on separate hosts to communicate with each other. This option is mostly relevant to Docker Swarm so we won't be going into detail here. But we will look into how Kubernetes handles a similar use case at the end.

Docker also provides option to integrate with a specific networking driver provided by an external party through a plugin based interface.

What distinguishes Markdown from many other lightweight markup syntaxes, which are often easier to write, is its readability.
